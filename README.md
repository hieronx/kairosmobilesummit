BARCELONA MOBILE SUMMIT
==================

###A two-day conference to unleash the power of mobile solutions

It is with tremendous excitement that we announce the Kairos Mobile Summit, which will take place in Barcelona, Spain on October 18-19, 2013. Held in direct partnership with the Mobile World Capital, this event is an opportunity to identify and accelerate the next generation of cutting-edge mobile ventures.

This meeting of the mobile minds will focus specifically on the massive potential of mobile technology to tackle big global challenges. Kairos fellows will once again join forces with expert mentors to create innovative new mobile solutions, and we will also showcase existing Kairos ventures that are already pushing the world forward in this space. The event will be hosted in the iconic Telefónica building - the Mobile World Capital Foundation HQ - in Plaça Catalunya, Barcelona.

Get ready for the Mobile Innovation Challenge, a hackathon where the best ideas from the ideation sessions will be crafted into business models with the guidance of mentors. We’ll have a Mobile Demo Day where the teams of the most innovative mobile startups will pitch their long-term plan to tackle a global challenge. Following our new partnership model, this is not simply a one-time collaboration – the top mobile ventures will earn the opportunity to attend the Mobile World Congress 2014 in Barcelona on behalf of Kairos.

See you in Barcelona!
